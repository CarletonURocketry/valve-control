 *
 * Please feel free to contact me with questions about this code if you are an
 * InSpace member from future years.
 *
 * This code does the following:
 *
 * 1. Wait for the continuity line to read low (disconnected)
 * 2. Turn on the MOSFET switches that output 24V battery power on the solenoid
 *    power lines
 * 3. Begin a timer for the flight duration (configurable, somewhere in the
 *    minutes range)
 * 4. Once the timer ends, turn off the MOSFET switches
